# Frontend Android build (Capacitor)

This project includes an Android project under `android/` generated by Capacitor. You can build an APK from the web bundle by either using the Capacitor CLI or opening the Android project in Android Studio.

## Quick local steps (dev machine)

1. Install dependencies and build the web assets:

```pwsh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Sync the build assets into the native project and copy them into the Android project:

```pwsh
# install Capacitor CLI locally if missing (npx will download if necessary)
# Copy web build into android project
npm run cap:sync
```

3. Open the Android project in Android Studio and build APK:

- Open Android Studio → Open an existing project → `frontend/android`
- Wait for Gradle to sync and install any missing SDK components
- Choose 'Build' → 'Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)' → 'Build APK(s)'
- After build completes, Android Studio shows a link to the generated APK


## Alternative: Remote URL (no recompile for updates)

If you prefer to have your Android app load the live site and avoid re-building the native APK on every frontend change, edit `android/app/src/main/java/.../MainActivity.java` or the Capacitor configuration to point at a remote `server.url`. This requires the user device to have internet access but avoids repeated native builds.

## Notes

- The current project already contains an `android/` folder and appears to have previous web assets under `android/app/src/main/assets/public`. If you want to produce a fresh APK, run `npm run build` and `npm run cap:sync` so the native project is updated with current web files.
- Keep secrets (keys, service_role) out of client-side builds.
